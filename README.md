# StartUp Management Application (OOAD Mini Project)

“Start-up Management System” is the best software for managing highly customizable Start-up
ideas and bypassing the technical aspect of establishing a start-up. In today’s generation
people prefer getting products delivered to their homes and are hence dependent on startup’s
to cater their varied product needs which in turn causes a lot of people to ponder into this field
but step back due to the huge amount of work required in addition to the development of the
product. Till date many of the transactions, log maintenance, complaint records, Human
resource management are being done manually. Maintaining huge records and paper copies
for each of these Start-up’s and users is cumbersome and thus we require an integrated and
hassle free system that can replace all this and work effortlessly and effectively and help
manage startup communities.
